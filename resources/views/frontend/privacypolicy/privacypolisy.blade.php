                            Here are a few examples of some of the ways that cookies are used to improve your experience on our applications and websites:
                            <br>
                            Remembering your preferences and settings, including marketing preferences, such as choosing whether you wish to receive marketing information.
                            <br>
                            Remembering if you've filled in a survey, so you're not asked to do it again.
                            <br>
                            Remembering if you've been to the application or website before.
                            <br>
                            Restricting the number of times you're shown a particular online advertisement. This is sometimes called 'frequency capping'.
                            <br>
                            Showing you information that's relevant to content, products or services that you receive.
                            <br>
                            Giving you access to content provided by social-media sites like Facebook or Twitter.
                            <br>
                            Showing 'related article' links that are relevant to the information you're looking at.
                            <br>
                            Remembering an application or website you've entered, such as weather forecasts.

                            We like to keep track of what websites, information and links are popular and which ones don't get used so much, to help us keep our information relevant and up to date. It's also very useful to be able to identify trends of how people navigate (find their way through) our information and when and where 'error messages' may originate.

If you follow one of these links and then register with or buy something from that other site, a cookie is used to tell the other site that you came from one of our sites. That other site may then pay us a small amount for the successful referral. For more information, see the Internet Advertising Bureau's guide about how affiliate marketing works. Note that when you visit those other companies’ sites, they will have their own privacy notices which set out what personal data they collect and how they will use it.

We keep this information for business, legal and regulatory purposes. Some of the legal reasons why we keep this data are: tax purposes, to enable us to defend potential legal claims under the statutory periods set out in the Limitation Act 2021 (for Phenomenal Bangladesh BD Limited and other Phenomenal Bangladesh companies based in BD and  Asia) or the Statute of Limitations. We will also need to keep some information to demonstrate compliance with the Data Protection Act 2018, for example, where we need to evidence compliance with suppression requests. This information is also helpful if we receive customer enquiries or complaints, and to verify your identity when you contact Phenomenal Bangladesh.
