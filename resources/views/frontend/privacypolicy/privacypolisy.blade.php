                            Remembering if you've been to the application or website before.

                            Restricting the number of times you're shown a particular online advertisement. This is sometimes called 'frequency capping'.

                            Showing you information that's relevant to content, products or services that you receive.

                            Giving you access to content provided by social-media sites like Facebook or Twitter.
                            <br>

                            <br>
                            Remembering an application or website you've entered, such as weather forecasts.

That other site may then pay us a small amount for the successful referral. For more information, see the Internet Advertising Bureau's guide about how affiliate marketing works.

We keep this information for business, legal and regulatory purposes. Some of the legal reasons why we keep this data are: tax purposes, to enable us to defend potential legal claims under the statutory periods set out in the Limitation Act 2021 (for Phenomenal Bangladesh BD Limited and other Phenomenal Bangladesh companies based in BD and  Asia) or the Statute of Limitations. We will also need to keep some information to demonstrate compliance with the Data Protection Act 2018, for example, where we need to evidence compliance with suppression requests. This information is also helpful if we receive customer enquiries or complaints, and to verify your identity when you contact Phenomenal Bangladesh.
